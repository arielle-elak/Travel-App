Travel:

"It will show you that the world is bigger than your world."
- Trevor Noah

Imagine being able to have a perfectly curated list of activities to do in any city in the world, along with the current weather. Our app aims to do just this.

## Concept
Description:
An interactive app that allows a user to explore a curated list of recommended cities to travel to, and things to do in them.

Why?
Places like Trip Advisor are very impersonal. Sometimes it takes a true native to give you the best recommendations for things to do and see.

User Story:
AS A USER
WHEN I SELECT a city from the home page.
I AM PRESENTED with the current weather and suggested activities for that selected city, curated by one of our local guides.

## Process:
Technologies used:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery
- OpenWeather API
- Pixabay API


Breakdown of tasks and roles:

- Constance: Events Widget
- Abdul: Activities Widget
- Arielle: Restaurant Widget
- Cham: Weather Widget

Challenges:

- Losing a team member halfway through
- Coordinating and coding together

Successes:

- Constance: Activities Widget
- Abdul: Weather Widget
- Arielle: Home Page
- Coming together as a team to make a functional app!

## Directions for Future Development:

- Implement an option for choosing the time of year to filter suggestions
- Create a activities widget to provide year round entertainment options
- Itinerary builder â€“ click and drag activities, restaurants, and events into a calendar to plan your trip.
- Add Wiki API to pull up current information about famous sites
